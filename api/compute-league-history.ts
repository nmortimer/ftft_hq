 * ONE-TIME (well, "run occasionally") heavy computation — builds full
 * league history (all-time record, head-to-head vs every team,
 * championship/placement history, last-place finishes) from Fleaflicker's
 * own data across every season 2018-present, and caches the result in
 * Redis. The team pages just read the cached result (api/league-history.ts)
 * — this endpoint is only ever run manually, by visiting it (GET), same
 * pattern as the other one-time endpoints in this project.
 *
 * CONFIRMED against a real response before being built: FetchLeagueScoreboard
 * games carry real `isChampionshipGame` / `isThirdPlaceGame` booleans (not
 * inferred) — verified against 2018's actual championship (Grand Rapids
 * Growlers over Standale Stampede) and third-place game (Jenison
 * Juggernauts over Boulder Bandits). Franchise identity is tracked by
 * `fleaflickerId`, never by name — team names change across seasons
 * (Growlers -> Denver Diamondbacks, Juggernauts -> Olde Town Osos, etc.)
 * but the id is permanent, exactly like the rest of this project treats it.
 *
 * "Last place" per season is NOT taken from any consolation-bracket flag
 * (no such field has been confirmed) — it's simply whichever team had the
 * worst regular-season record that year (tiebreak: lowest points for),
 * read directly from standings. Reliable and needs no untested field.
 *
 * Fetches one season at a time (parallel across that season's weeks, but
 * seasons themselves run sequentially) rather than firing every request
 * for every season at once — this is ~150+ external requests in total;
 * capping concurrency to one season's worth at a time is a deliberate
 * safety margin against rate limits and serverless timeouts, at some
 * cost to total wall-clock time. This endpoint can take a while to run.
