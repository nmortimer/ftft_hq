/**
 * ONE-TIME REPAIR — fixes damage already done by a real bug in sync.ts's
 * taxi/IR reconciliation (now fixed there too, see the comment in that
 * file). The bug: "no reserve-change event found for this player" was
 * being treated as "confirmed not on taxi/IR," silently clearing real
 * designations for players whose taxi/IR status was set before this
 * app's activity-feed tracking ever started (e.g. initial preseason
 * roster construction), which never generates a reserveChange event at
 * all. Confirmed real casualties: Boulder's Cam Ward/Oscar Delp, South
 * Bend's Kyle Williams — all silently kicked off taxi, each one wrongly
 * added back into cap-used totals.
 *
 * This restores, for each currently-live contract matched by id to the
 * original seed (realContracts.ts): any taxiYears/irYears entry the
 * seed had that the live data is now missing — but ONLY for years where
 * fetchReserveStatusMap has NO event at all for that player. If there
 * IS a confirmed event, that's trusted over the seed, exactly like the
 * fixed sync.ts does — this never overrides a real, confirmed move.
 *
 * GET on purpose, same as restore-seed-data.ts and
 * merge-new-seed-contracts.ts — visiting the URL is enough.
