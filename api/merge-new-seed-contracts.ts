/**
 * SAFE, additive-only — unlike restore-seed-data.ts (which wipes and
 * replaces everything), this only ADDS whatever's in the bundled
 * realContracts.ts but missing from live Redis data, matched by id.
 * Everything already in Redis (synced trades, confirmed cuts/buyouts,
 * manual edits) is left completely untouched.
 *
 * Built for exactly this situation: new rows get added to
 * realContracts.ts in code (like the 14 pre-existing buyout entries,
 * ids 234-247) AFTER the app has already started using Redis as its
 * source of truth, so just deploying the new code doesn't make them
 * appear — Redis's existing full contract list overrides the bundled
 * file on every load. This merges the gap in one safe step.
 *
 * GET on purpose, so it's triggerable by just visiting the URL, same
 * as restore-seed-data.ts.
