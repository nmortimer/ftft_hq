 * JSON behavior), so a `reserveChange` item's shape tells you the move:
 *   - no `taxi`, no `removed`  → added to IR
 *   - `taxi: true`, no `removed` → added to TAXI
 *   - `removed: true`, no `taxi` → removed from IR (activated)
 *   - `removed: true, taxi: true` → removed from TAXI (promoted)
 * Verified this against 11 real players in the feed, cross-checked
 * against their real known status (e.g. A.J. Brown's real-IR injury
 * lines up with a bare add-to-IR event; Denzel Boston and Harold
 * Fannin, both real active contributors now, show promoted-off-taxi
 * events) — all 11 matched before this was wired in.
 *
 * The feed is paginated (30 items/page) and this league had ~1300
 * total items at last check, so pages are fetched in parallel (not
 * sequentially) to keep this fast. For each player, only the event
 * with the LATEST timeEpochMilli matters — a player can cycle through
